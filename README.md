# ASP .NET Identity Providers for MySQL and SQLite

This repository contains the following ASP .NET Identity providers:
<ul>
  <li>AspNet.Identity.MySQL</li>
  <li>AspNet.Identity.SQLite</li>
</ul>

There is also a sample ASP .NET MVC web application that uses either one of providers, to help you play with the providers in your development environment.
