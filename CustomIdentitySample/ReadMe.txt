This is the default ASP .NET web template as generated by Visual Studio 2015, with the Identity part driven by either MySQL or SQLite.

Follow these steps in order to select MySQL or SQLite as a database backend:
- Make sure the web application (CustomIdentitySample) references the desired identity provider (AspNet.Identity.MySQL or AspNet.Identity.SQLite). You may delete the reference to the provider that is not needed.
- Search for TODO> throughout the solution and follow the notes.
